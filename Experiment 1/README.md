# Experiment 1: Study Experiment

This experiment involved a theoretical study of the fundamental concepts of microprocessors and programming languages.

## Topics Covered

### a. History and Evolution of Microprocessors
- **Generations**: From 4-bit (Intel 4004) to modern 64-bit multi-core processors.
- **Key Milestones**: 8085, 8086, Pentium series, Core series.
- **Moore's Law**: Observation and impact on transistor density.

### b. Levels of Programming Languages
- **Machine Language**: Binary code directly executed by hardware.
- **Assembly Language**: Low-level symbolic representation (mnemonics).
- **High-Level Language**: Abstraction from hardware (C, C++, Java, Python).
- **Comparison**: Execution speed, ease of programming, portability, and memory usage.

### c. Comparison of Intel Processors
| Feature | Intel Core i3 | Intel Core i5 | Intel Core i7 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cores** | Dual/Quad | Quad/Hexa | Hexa/Octa+ |
| **Hyper-Threading** | Yes (some models) | No (mostly) | Yes |
| **Turbo Boost** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Cache Size** | Smaller (e.g., 6MB) | Medium (e.g., 12MB) | Larger (e.g., 16MB+) |
| **Use Case** | Basic tasks, Office | Gaming, Multitasking | Content Creation, Heavy Computation |
